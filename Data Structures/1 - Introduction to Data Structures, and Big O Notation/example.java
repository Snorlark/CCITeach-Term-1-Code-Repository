     * Introduction to Data Structures and Big O Notation
     * 
     * Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it
     * can be accessed and modified efficiently. Understanding the common data
     * structures and their performance characteristics is crucial for writing
     * efficient algorithms. Big O notation is used to describe the performance or
     * complexity of an algorithm in terms of time and space as the input size grows.
     */

    /*
     * Common Data Structures:
     * 
     * 1. Arrays: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
     * 2. Linked Lists: A sequence of elements where each element points to the next.
     * 3. Stacks: A collection of elements that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
     * 4. Queues: A collection of elements that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
     * 5. Hash Tables: A data structure that implements an associative array, 
     *    a structure that can map keys to values.
     * 6. Trees: A hierarchical structure with nodes connected by edges.
     * 7. Graphs: A set of connected nodes.
     */

    /*
     * Big O Notation:
     * 
     * O(1): Constant time – the operation does not depend on the size of the input.
     * O(n): Linear time – the time grows linearly with the input size.
     * O(n^2): Quadratic time – the time grows quadratically as the input size increases.
     * O(log n): Logarithmic time – the time grows logarithmically as the input size increases.
     * O(n log n): Linearithmic time – often seen in efficient sorting algorithms.
